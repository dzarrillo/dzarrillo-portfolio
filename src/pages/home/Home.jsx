          Four years ago, I founded DZartek LLC. During that time, I also
          developed Full stack web sites and Android apps. These apps were
          designed using react, restful web services, MongoDB, SQLite, google
          maps and Firebase technology. Currently there are six free Android
          apps in the Google store posted under DZartek.

          Prior to founding DZartek, I worked ten years at Credit-Suisse in the
          IT department. While at Credit-Suisse, I facilitated solutions to
          problems with â€œlive trades" and managed the batch night cycle for Asia
          Pacific. In addition, if any trade deadlines were missed, I
          immediately routed and assigned an alert to the responsible department
          to ensure that the appropriate corrective resolution(s) took place.
